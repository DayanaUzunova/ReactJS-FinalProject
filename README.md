# ReactJS-FinalProject
## Project Description:
This is my final project with ReactJS. 
My project is about creating a dynamic online platform called Courses Management System, dedicated to uploading and accessing a wide variety of educational courses. The goal of this website is to offer a comprehensive and diverse library of web courses, catering to learners from different backgrounds and with varying interests. The platform allows users to easily learn more about something they are interested in. Every course has details. They can leave their comment as a feedback below each course to say whether they like it or not. There is a search box where users can search for a course they want to learn about. The project is still in progress.
